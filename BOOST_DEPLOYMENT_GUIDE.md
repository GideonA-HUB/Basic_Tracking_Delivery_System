# 🚀 BOOST BUTTON DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## Overview
The Boost button has been successfully implemented to allow customers to fast-track their withdrawals for $740 using NOWPayments API integration.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Boost Button UI**
- Added a beautiful gradient "🚀 Boost ($740)" button next to "View Complete List" button
- Styled with purple-to-pink gradient and hover effects
- Responsive design that works on all devices

### 2. **NOWPayments API Integration**
- **Service Method**: `create_boost_payment()` in `investments/services.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `/investments/api/payments/boost/create/`
- **Payment Type**: `boost` (tracked in database)
- **Amount**: $740 USD (configurable)

### 3. **Payment Flow**
1. Customer clicks "🚀 Boost ($740)" button
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. Payment request is created via NOWPayments API
4. Payment modal shows:
   - Crypto payment address
   - Amount to send (in crypto)
   - USD value ($740)
   - Copy address button
   - "Pay with NOWPayments" button (opens NOWPayments page)

### 4. **Database Integration**
- Uses existing `PaymentTransaction` model
- Payment type: `boost`
- Tracks payment status, amounts, and NOWPayments data
- Integrates with existing IPN webhook system

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Backend Files
1. **`investments/services.py`**
   - Added `create_boost_payment()` method
   - Integrates with existing NOWPayments service

2. **`investments/views.py`**
   - Added `create_boost_payment()` view
   - Handles API requests and responses

3. **`investments/urls.py`**
   - Added URL pattern: `path('api/payments/boost/create/', views.create_boost_payment, name='create-boost-payment')`

### Frontend Files
4. **`templates/investments/dashboard.html`**
   - Added Boost button HTML
   - Added complete JavaScript functionality
   - Payment modal with NOWPayments integration

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. **Railway Deployment**
The deployment is already configured:
- **Procfile**: `web: python start_with_withdrawals.py`
- **railway.toml**: `startCommand = "python start_with_withdrawals.py"`
- **Start Script**: `start_with_withdrawals.py` (handles migrations, static files, data population)

### 2. **Environment Variables Required**
Make sure these are set in Railway:
```
NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET=your_ipn_secret_here
NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_URL=https://meridian-asset-logistics.up.railway.app/investments/api/payments/ipn/
```

### 3. **Deploy to Railway**
```bash
# The system is ready to deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Add Boost button with NOWPayments integration"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Customer Experience
1. **Dashboard View**: Customer sees withdrawal list with "View Complete List" and "🚀 Boost ($740)" buttons
2. **Click Boost**: Confirmation dialog appears
3. **Payment Creation**: System creates NOWPayments payment request
4. **Payment Modal**: Shows crypto address and payment details
5. **Payment**: Customer can copy address or use NOWPayments button
6. **Fast Track**: After payment, customer's withdrawal moves to top of list

### Technical Flow
1. **Frontend**: JavaScript calls `/investments/api/payments/boost/create/`
2. **Backend**: Creates `PaymentTransaction` with type `boost`
3. **NOWPayments**: Creates payment request via API
4. **Database**: Stores payment details and NOWPayments response
5. **IPN**: NOWPayments sends webhook when payment is confirmed
6. **Update**: System updates withdrawal priority/status

## 🔍 Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test the boost functionality
python Basic_Tracking_Delivery_System/test_boost_functionality.py

# Test withdrawal system
python Basic_Tracking_Delivery_System/verify_withdrawal_deployment.py
```

### Production Testing
1. Deploy to Railway
2. Visit dashboard
3. Click "🚀 Boost ($740)" button
4. Verify payment modal appears
5. Test payment flow (use test crypto if available)

## 📊 Database Schema

### PaymentTransaction Model
```python
# New boost payments will have:
payment_type = 'boost'
amount_usd = 740.00
payment_status = 'pending'  # or 'completed' after payment
nowpayments_payment_id = 'NOWPayments payment ID'
payment_address = 'Crypto address for payment'
amount_crypto = 'Amount in crypto currency'
crypto_currency = 'Crypto currency (e.g., BTC, ETH)'
```
