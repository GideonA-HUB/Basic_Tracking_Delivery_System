- ✅ Runs in **background thread** (no Celery needed)

#### **2. Enhanced Frontend** (`production_live_dashboard.js`)
- ✅ **Beautiful real-time dashboard** like CoinMarketCap
- ✅ **Live price updates** with smooth animations
- ✅ **Movement counter animations** that increment
- ✅ **Enhanced pie chart** with better colors and animations
- ✅ **WebSocket connection management** with auto-reconnection

#### **3. Updated Template**
- ✅ **Connection status indicators** (Live/Disconnected)
- ✅ **Last updated timestamps**
- ✅ **Manual refresh buttons**
