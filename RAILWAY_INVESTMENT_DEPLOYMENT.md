### 2. Database Structure
- Investment categories (Cryptocurrency, Real Estate, Diamonds & Gems, Fine Art, Precious Metals, Collectibles)
- Investment items with pricing and investment options
- Price history tracking for real-time growth monitoring
- User investment portfolios and transaction history
- NOWPayments webhook integration for payment status updates

## Railway Deployment Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables
The following environment variables must be set in Railway:

```bash
# NOWPayments Configuration (Required for payment processing)
NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY=your_nowpayments_api_key
NOWPAYMENTS_API_SECRET=your_nowpayments_api_secret
NOWPAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Site Configuration
SITE_URL=https://meridian-asset-logistics.up.railway.app

# Existing Railway Variables (should already be set)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=meridian-asset-logistics.up.railway.app
```

### 2. Database Migration
The investment system will automatically migrate when deployed due to the Railway start command:
```bash
python manage.py migrate --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
```

### 3. Sample Data Population
After deployment, run the following command to populate initial investment data:
```bash
python manage.py setup_investments --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add investment system with NOWPayments integration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Railway
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Select your project
- Go to Variables tab
- Add the NOWPayments configuration variables
- Update SITE_URL if needed

### 3. Deploy
Railway will automatically deploy when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### 4. Verify Deployment
- Check Railway logs for successful migration
- Visit `/investments/` to verify the marketplace is working
- Test the investment dashboard at `/investments/dashboard/`

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Create Superuser (if needed)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
```

### 2. Populate Sample Data
```bash
python manage.py setup_investments --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
```

### 3. Configure NOWPayments Webhook
- Set webhook URL in NOWPayments dashboard: `https://meridian-asset-logistics.up.railway.app/investments/webhook/`
- Ensure webhook secret matches the environment variable

## System Verification

### 1. Check Investment Models
```bash
python manage.py shell --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
>>> from investments.models import InvestmentCategory, InvestmentItem
>>> print(f"Categories: {InvestmentCategory.objects.count()}")
>>> print(f"Items: {InvestmentItem.objects.count()}")
```

### 2. Test URL Routing
```bash
python manage.py shell --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
>>> from django.urls import reverse
>>> print(reverse('investments:investment-marketplace'))
>>> print(reverse('investments:investment-dashboard'))
```

### 3. Verify Admin Interface
- Access `/admin/` with superuser credentials
- Verify investment models are visible and manageable

## Security Considerations

### 1. NOWPayments Integration
- API keys are stored securely in environment variables
- Webhook verification using HMAC signatures
- CSRF protection enabled for all forms

### 2. User Authentication
- Login required for investment operations
- Portfolio data is user-specific and isolated
- Transaction history is properly secured

### 3. Production Settings
- DEBUG=False in production
- Secure cookie settings enabled
- HSTS headers configured
- XSS protection enabled

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Logs
- Investment operations are logged for monitoring
- Payment webhook responses are tracked
- Error handling with proper logging

### 2. Performance
- Database queries are optimized with select_related
- Caching implemented for portfolio calculations
- Efficient price history updates

### 3. Updates
- Regular price updates via management commands
- Portfolio recalculation on investment changes
- Automatic cleanup of old price history data

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **NOWPayments API errors**: Check API key configuration
2. **Webhook failures**: Verify webhook URL and secret
3. **Migration errors**: Check database connection and permissions
4. **Template errors**: Verify static files are collected

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check system status
python manage.py check --deploy --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production

# Verify models
python manage.py shell --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production

# Test specific functionality
python manage.py test investments --settings=delivery_tracker.settings_production
```

## Conclusion
The investment system is fully implemented and ready for production deployment on Railway. All necessary configurations have been made, and the system includes comprehensive error handling, security measures, and monitoring capabilities.

**Next Steps:**
1. Set NOWPayments environment variables in Railway
2. Deploy the updated code
3. Run sample data population
4. Test the investment marketplace and dashboard
5. Configure NOWPayments webhook URL

The system will provide users with a professional investment platform featuring real-time tracking, secure payments, and comprehensive portfolio management.
