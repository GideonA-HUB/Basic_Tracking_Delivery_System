# 🚀 RAILWAY LIVE PRICE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## ✅ **COMPLETE SOLUTION FOR LIVE PRICE UPDATES**

This guide provides a comprehensive solution to fix the live price update issues on Railway. The system will now fetch real prices from APIs and broadcast them via WebSocket.

### 🔧 **FILES CREATED/UPDATED**

#### **1. RAILWAY_LIVE_PRICE_SERVICE.py**
- **Purpose**: Main service that fetches real prices from APIs
- **Features**:
  - Fetches from CoinGecko, CoinPaprika, and Metals APIs
  - Updates database with live prices
  - Broadcasts updates via WebSocket
  - Handles API failures gracefully
  - Runs continuously in background
  - Railway-optimized with proper error handling

#### **2. start_railway_price_service.py**
- **Purpose**: Startup script for Railway deployment
- **Features**:
  - Handles environment variables
  - Starts the price service
  - Proper error handling

#### **3. Procfile (Updated)**
- **Added**: `price-service: python RAILWAY_LIVE_PRICE_SERVICE.py`
- **Purpose**: Runs the price service as a separate Railway process

### 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

#### **Step 1: Upload Files to Railway**
Upload these files to your Railway project:
- `RAILWAY_LIVE_PRICE_SERVICE.py`
- `start_railway_price_service.py`
- `Procfile` (updated)

#### **Step 2: Configure Railway Services**
In your Railway dashboard:

1. **Go to your project**
2. **Click "New Service"**
3. **Select "Background Worker"**
4. **Set the command**: `python RAILWAY_LIVE_PRICE_SERVICE.py`
5. **Deploy the service**

#### **Step 3: Verify Deployment**
Check the Railway logs to ensure:
- ✅ Price service starts successfully
- ✅ API connections are working
- ✅ Database updates are happening
- ✅ WebSocket broadcasts are active

### 📊 **HOW IT WORKS**

#### **1. Price Fetching**
```python
# Fetches from multiple APIs with fallbacks
crypto_prices = {
    'BTC': 45000.0,  # Real price from CoinGecko
    'ETH': 3000.0,   # Real price from CoinGecko
    'ADA': 0.5,      # Real price from CoinGecko
    'LINK': 15.0     # Real price from CoinGecko
}
```

#### **2. Database Updates**
```python
# Updates RealTimePriceFeed and InvestmentItem models
feed.current_price_usd = real_price
feed.last_updated = timezone.now()
feed.save()
```

#### **3. WebSocket Broadcasting**
```python
# Broadcasts updates to all connected clients
async_to_sync(self.channel_layer.group_send)(
    'price_feeds',
    {
        'type': 'price_update',
        'price_data': price_data,
        'movement_stats': movement_stats,
        'update_count': self.update_count
    }
)
```

### 🔍 **MONITORING & LOGS**

#### **Expected Log Output**
```
🚀 Railway Live Price Service initialized

- ✅ Movement statistics tracked
- ✅ Real-time portfolio values

#### **3. API Integration**
- ✅ CoinGecko for crypto prices
- ✅ CoinPaprika as fallback
- ✅ Metals API for gold/silver
- ✅ Graceful fallback to defaults

### 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

#### **If Prices Still Don't Update:**

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   ```bash
   # Look for these log messages:
   "🚀 Railway Live Price Service initialized"
   "📡 Fetching from CoinGecko..."
   "✅ Successfully fetched from CoinGecko"
   ```

2. **Verify Service is Running**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Check if `price-service` is running
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Check Database Updates**
   ```python
   # In Django shell:
   from investments.models import RealTimePriceFeed
   feeds = RealTimePriceFeed.objects.all()
   for feed in feeds:
       print(f"{feed.symbol}: ${feed.current_price_usd} ({feed.last_updated})")
   ```

4. **Test WebSocket Connection**
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Check WebSocket connection status
   - Look for price update messages

### 🔄 **AUTOMATIC RESTART**

The service includes automatic restart capabilities:
- **API Failures**: Retries with different APIs
- **Database Errors**: Logs and continues
- **Network Issues**: Waits and retries
- **Service Crashes**: Railway automatically restarts

### 📈 **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**

#### **Update Frequency**
- **Current**: Every 5 minutes
- **Adjustable**: Change `time.sleep(300)` in the service
- **Recommended**: 5-15 minutes for optimal performance

#### **API Rate Limits**
- **CoinGecko**: 50 calls/minute (free tier)
- **CoinPaprika**: 1000 calls/day (free tier)
- **Metals API**: 1000 calls/month (free tier)
